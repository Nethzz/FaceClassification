Facial image classification is a growing area of interest in machine learning.In this project, we explore machine learning techniques to classify facial images based on three attributes:

Head position: straight, left, right, up
Facial expression: neutral, happy, sad, angry
Eye state: sunglasses, open
By implementing various machine learning classifiers, we aim to achieve accurate predictions for these attributes.
